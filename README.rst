Modbus TCP Repository
.....................

:Latest release: 1.0.1rc0
:Maintainer: XMOS
:Description: Modbus TCP (Slave) component


Firmware overview
=================

This is a Modbus TCP Server component (A Modbus Slave). Modbus protocol specification and messaging implementation guide can be found here:

http://www.modbus.org/specs.php

The Modbus TCP Server component accepts data from the TCP layers and processes them for Modbus commands. If the received TCP data is a Modbus command, the component requests data from/to the user application. The request (Modbus Command) is usually to read/write values from/to registers, coils, etc... After this, the component forms the required Modbus response, sends it back to the TCP client (Modbus Master) and waits for next Modbus command.

Fixed Issues
============

  * Address range checks introduced in the module according to the protocol implementation. 
  * Read request fails if holding register has a value that is 0.
  * Toggling of LED in write coil implementation for consecutive execution.

Known Issues
