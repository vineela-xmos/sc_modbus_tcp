===========================

:scope: Example
:description: Demonstrates Modbus slave with GPIO sliceCARD
:keywords: ModbusTCP
:boards: XA-SK-E100, XA-SK-GPIO

A demonstration application in which the Modbus TCP Server component is used with the XA-SK-E100 and XA-SK-GPIO sliceCARDs together to receive commands from a the SimplyModbus(TM) Software running on a Windows PC over TCP. The commands can be issued to:

* Turn GPIO sliceCARD LEDs ON and OFF
* Read the room temperature via the on-board ADC
* Display GPIO sliceCARD button presses
* Read Timer's LSB value.
